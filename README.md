## Standalone repository notice

This repository is a public standalone derivative of the upstream source at
[earendil-works/pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

Git history has been preserved where possible. Upstream issues and pull
requests were not migrated. The upstream MIT license attribution is retained
in [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

This repository is not affiliated with or endorsed by the upstream maintainers
unless explicitly stated.

Before package publication, release tagging, or wider distribution, re-audit
license attribution, source provenance, GitHub Actions, secrets, generated
artifacts, and private data.

## About

Pi Agent Harness is a self-extensible coding agent with text tool-call protocol support for non-native tool-use models.

This repository currently preserves upstream package names internally.
Do not publish packages from this repository until package names, scopes,
license attribution, and release provenance are reviewed.

* **[@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent](packages/coding-agent)**: Interactive coding agent CLI
* **[@earendil-works/pi-agent-core](packages/agent)**: Agent runtime with tool calling and state management
* **[@earendil-works/pi-ai](packages/ai)**: Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, …)

## Permissions & Containerization

Pi does not include a built-in permission system for restricting filesystem, process, network, or credential access. By default, it runs with the permissions of the user and process that launched it.

If you need stronger boundaries, containerize or sandbox Pi. See [packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md](packages/coding-agent/docs/containerization.md) for three patterns:

- **Gondolin extension**: keep `pi` and provider auth on the host while routing built-in tools and `!` commands into a local Linux micro-VM.
- **Plain Docker**: run the whole `pi` process in a local container for simple isolation.
- **OpenShell**: run the whole `pi` process in a policy-controlled sandbox.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project-specific rules (for both humans and agents). Longer term plans for the upstream Pi project can be found in [RFCs](https://rfc.earendil.com/keyword/pi/).

## Development

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts  # Install all dependencies without running lifecycle scripts
npm run build        # Build all packages
npm run check        # Lint, format, and type check
./test.sh            # Run tests (skips LLM-dependent tests without API keys)
./pi-test.sh         # Run pi from sources (can be run from any directory)
```

## Supply-chain hardening

We treat npm dependency changes as reviewed code changes.

- Direct external dependencies are pinned to exact versions. Internal workspace packages remain version-ranged.
- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true` and `min-release-age=2` to avoid same-day dependency releases during npm resolution.
- `package-lock.json` is the dependency ground truth. Pre-commit blocks accidental lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1` is set.
- `npm run check` verifies pinned direct deps, native TypeScript import compatibility, and the generated coding-agent shrinkwrap.
- The published CLI package includes `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`, generated from the root lockfile, to pin transitive deps for npm users.
- Release smoke tests use `npm run release:local` to build, pack, and create isolated npm and Bun installs outside the repo before tagging a release.
- Local release installs, documented npm installs, and `pi update --self` use `--ignore-scripts` where supported.
- CI installs with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and a scheduled GitHub workflow runs `npm audit --omit=dev` plus `npm audit signatures --omit=dev`.
- Shrinkwrap generation has an explicit allowlist for dependency lifecycle scripts; new lifecycle-script deps fail checks until reviewed.
